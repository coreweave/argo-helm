In order to access the server UI you have the following options:

1. kubectl port-forward service/{{ include "argo-cd.fullname" . }}-server -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} 8080:443

    and then open the browser on http://localhost:8080 and accept the certificate

Visit the ingress URL:

2. {{ include "coreweave.externalDnsName" . }}

{{ if eq (toString (index .Values.configs.cm "admin.enabled")) "true" -}}
After reaching the UI the first time you can login with username: admin and the random password generated during the installation. You can find the password by running:

kubectl -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d

(You should delete the initial secret afterwards as suggested by the Getting Started Guide: https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/#4-login-using-the-cli)
{{ else if or (index .Values.configs.cm "dex.config") (index .Values.configs.cm "oidc.config") -}}
After reaching the UI the first time you can login using Dex or OIDC.
{{ else -}}
After reaching the UI the first time you cannot login with username and password since you've disabled it. You should enable admin back or configure Dex via `configs.cm.dex.config` or OIDC via `configs.cm.oidc.config`.
{{ end -}}
